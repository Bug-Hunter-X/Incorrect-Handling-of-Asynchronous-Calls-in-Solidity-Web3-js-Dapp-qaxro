function getBalance() {
  const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(address);
  return balance;
}

// ... later in the code ...

if (getBalance() < 10) {
  // ... do something ...
}

This code is incorrect because `getBalance()` is an asynchronous function.  The `if` statement will not wait for `getBalance()` to complete before checking if the result is less than 10.  This can lead to unexpected behavior. The if condition will always be false since getBalance() returns a Promise, not the actual balance.
